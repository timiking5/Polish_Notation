# Polish_Notation
Hello, it is my implementation of polish notation.
To use it, you can run a programm then input an expression (sin(x) for example);
Supported operations: ln, sin, cos, tan, ctg, sqrt, +, -, *, ^;
Unsupported features: number with multiple digits (only supported single-digit numbers);
Output - the graph of the inputed expresseion, x from 0 to 4pi, y froom -1 to 1; and the y axis is inverted!!!
To see the expression encoded in polish you can printf the char * answer variable;
Don't forget to switch to master branch;
